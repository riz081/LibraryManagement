### Write-up (One Page)
You can create a document titled `design_and_performance_tuning.md` that includes:

**Design Choices:**
- **MVC Architecture**: Followed the MVC pattern for separation of concerns, ensuring that the application is maintainable and scalable.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Utilized Eloquent for interacting with the database, allowing for an expressive syntax and simplified queries.
- **RESTful API**: Designed the API endpoints to follow REST conventions, promoting a stateless and resource-oriented architecture.

**Performance Tuning Techniques:**
1. **Query Optimization**: Employed eager loading to reduce the number of database queries, fetching related data in a single query.
2. **Caching**: Used Laravelâ€™s built-in caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data (like lists of books and authors) in memory, significantly reducing load times for repeated requests.
3. **Unit Tests/Using Pest**: Wrote unit tests to ensure the correctness of the application, which also helps identify performance issues during development.
